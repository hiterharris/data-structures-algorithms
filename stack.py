# Appliction of Stack Data Structure:
# The back button in a browser saves all the URLs you have visited previously in a stack. 
# Each time you visit a new page, it is added on top of the stack. When you press the back button, 
# the current URL is removed from the stack, and the previous URL is accessed.
